I came across numerous solutions over the internet to work my way through the site.
## Realization

Starting off, I was inspired by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and even set-upped everything there using the [Congo](https://jpanther.github.io/congo/) theme (which btw is already v. cool in terms of look and customizations). However, soon enough I came to realize this one thing...

## Solution

Now I do know that there are about a ton of plugins available which can allow you to do just that. But I needed some kind of *all in one package*. That is exactly when I came across [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). This bad boy made everything about this site possible. With high level customizations and unique plugins, it allows everything to be crafted smoothly, I knew right from the start that *'this is the framework I needed'*.

### Resources

Long story short, I came across different ==ideas== people have built using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) to work with their workflows.
Following the resources which helped me craft one of my own:
